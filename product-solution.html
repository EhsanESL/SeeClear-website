                <h1> The Product Solution</h1>
                <h3>It&rsquo;s a bold statement, but the SeeClear product is the newest and brightest advancement in wing mirror technology in over 2 decades and this is why ;</h3>
<h3>The Solution is to offer a driver operated wing mirror cleaning / clearing solution that has a BIG benefits. We have also included &ldquo;RamAir Technology&rdquo; to self-clean on the fly. Our technology has been designed around the aerospace industry using the Coanda effect, we have also incorporated F1 Racing Car technology using Laminar flow technology. This is the most advanced rear view mirror in the marketplace today, proven scientifically and practically to work in a real environment. Critically the co efficient drag is reduce by 9% in comparison to a normal truck mirror, installing this product offers real time fuels savings.</h3>
<h3>The SeeClear product has been designed in conjunction with the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge under the direction of Prof. Hassan Shirvarni. Incorporating the Coanda effect with RamAir laminar flow technology, a stream of air, using the existing on board supply, is constantly blown over the mirror's surface as soon as the truck is in forward motion. The on board apparatus then gives the driver the capability to force clean (water) and clear the wing mirrors on the move in inclement weather / operating conditions.</h3>
<h3>The vision for the SeeClear product is to offer this to customers straight from production line as an added safety and environmental feature for truck manufacturers, or this could be offered as an optional extra for operators to choose. The product can also be retrofitted, increasing market potential.</h3>
<h3>Seeing (an) <strong>E</strong>volutionary product (that&rsquo;s) <strong>E</strong>nvironmentally friendly, (where the) <strong>C</strong>oanda effect (is used along with) <strong>L</strong>aminar flow technology, (that&rsquo;s) <strong>E</strong>conomic (to fit and operate), (reduces) <strong>Accidents</strong>, (and has) <strong>R</strong>amAir technology incorporated into the carbon reducing design is &ldquo;SEECLEAR&rdquo;</h3>
<h3><em>According to a Canadian Survey, weather conditions increase collision risk by 100% when operating in wet conditions especially. Elevated risk during rainfall appears to be related to visibility</em>. (Source: European Agency for Safety and Health at Work 2011)</h3>

<h3><strong>The Coanda effect </strong>is the tendency of a fluid to be attracted to a nearby surface. It confirms the right angle of air disbursement across the mirror glass surface to clear effectively.</h3>
<h3><strong>Laminar Flow </strong>occurs when a fluid flows in parallel layers, with no disruption between the layers. At low velocities the fluid tends to flow without lateral mixing, and adjacent layers slide past one another like playing cards. There are no cross currents perpendicular to the direction of flow, nor eddies or swirls of fluids. In laminar flow the motion of the particles of fluid is very orderly with all particles moving in straight lines parallel to the pipe walls. In fluid dynamics, laminar flow is a flow regime characterized by high momentum diffusion and low momentum convection.</h3>
<h3>A <strong>Ram-Air </strong>intake is an intake design which uses the dynamic air pressure created by vehicle motion to increase the static air pressure on the wing mirror surface, thus allowing a greater air mass flow over the mirror surface naturally clearing the mirror surface whilst the vehicle is in motion.</h3>
<h3>An example of the Coanada effect in action:</h3>
<h3>F1 teams managed to use the gases to enhance aerodynamics by directing them at the gap between the floor and the rear wheels using what is known as the 'Coanda' effect. Red Bull's progress in this area in late September was decisive in Sebastian Vettel beating Ferrari's Fernando Alonso to the Formula 1 drivers' championship in 2012. (Source : BBC Sport )</h3>

                <h1> Comperhensive Marketing Research</h1>
                <h3>In order to further understand the mirror issues experienced by HGV drivers, and to determine market potential for the See Clear Mirror Innovation, primary market research was conducted using a questionnaire. 72% of respondents reported checking their mirrors 4 or more times per minute and it was found that respondents had to clean dirty mirrors more frequently than wet mirrors. This supported the findings that dirty mirrors affect visibility more than wet mirrors. Further, over 70% of respondents rated a self-cleaning mirror 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 would be most useful in assisting their driving. These highly skewed results in favour of a self-cleaning mirror support the development of the See Clear Mirror Innovation. Respondents also noted that glare from the sun can also greatly affect their visibility and reported relying on heated mirrors. Therefore the See Clear Mirror Innovation should be as, or more, efficient as a heating component in clearing mirrors in all conditions, and should perform well during slow manoeuvres.</h3>
